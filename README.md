# Optimized Timetable Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm
This is my official university project.
Genetic Algorithm has been used for the generation of clash free timetable of mid exams keeping 
view of three constraints  

    1. No more than 420 students sit for exam at same time 
    2. No one student have more  than one exam at same time     
    3. No back to back examination


this project is extendable to any scheduling problem the code is open source
Feel to free for any pull requests.
We can  offer our services as well to make optimized scheduling
